                          COSMOPSO  (v1.0) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please READ carefully !! 

A. General Instructions : 
----------------------

1. This is a  cosmological parameter estimation code based on 
Partcile Swarm Optimization. 

2. This code is close to the code which I used for our PRD Paper 
(PHYSICAL REVIEW D 85, 123008 (2012)). 

3. You must cite the PRD paper if you use anything from this code 
or from the paper.

4. Only the programs which are in the folder are orginal and camb 
and WMAP likelihood code are passed so that one can quickly check.

5. If you want to use this code seriously then you must check 
the likelihood compuatation in particularly when you want to use 
Planck data.

6. At the time of writing this README the code was running fine 
with the WMAP 9 year data. 


B. Software Packages needed to compile/run the code 
-------------------------------------------------

1. WMAP 9 year likelihood code use data file in FITS format 
   so you must have 'cfitsio' installed.

2. LAPACK/BLAS is must since a lot of linear algebra stuff is done.

3. INTEL fortran compiler (ifort 14+) is needed. 

4. Here I just pass the WMAP 9 likelihood code and not the data
since that is around 900 MB. You must have copy of WMAP 9 likelihood
code installed with 'data' folder inside and use that.
Or you can edit the 'data' line in file :
wmap_likelihood_v5/WMAP_9yr_options.F90

5. The same is true for Planck Likelihood code plc and data 
You must have them ready. The path of Planck Likelihood code library
can be given in the 'Makefile' inside the 'src' directory.

6. This code runs on a cluster with MPI library installed 
and batch-q system. You must figure out how to submit MPI 
jobs on your batch-q system.

7. I avoid used commands like 'mpif90' since they unnecessary 
couple MPI librray with a compiler. I want to keep 
These things separate so that you have more flexibility.
The best way to compile your MPI program is :

FC prog.f90 -I/PATHOFMPI/include -L/PATHOFMPI/lib -lmpi ...
mpirun -np X ./a.out

where 'FC' is your FORTRAN compiler and you must fill the ...
on compile line. 

C. INPUT/OUTPUT file :
-------------------

1. The code uses three input files :
  psopara.in - PSO parameters  
  priors.inp -  priors for search  

  OUTPUT Files are : 
  gbest.dat : Has the best-fit point (X)  and value (Y)  
  pvals.dat : all the sample points

2. It is possible to run the multiple PSO realization
   and create chains and pass them through COSMOMC chain 
   processing pipeline. 

 
Please check the original papers inside the 'doc' folder.

I will welcome any comment/suggestion.
